1. natural phenomena happens we observae the data, model construction, calibration and validation then prediction happens related to the natural phenomena 
2. Experiment / Observations, Theory / Physical models and Computational / Data-driven models
3. Predictive xomputing: a workflow bridgin data, hypthesis/theory, and prediction. numerical simulation: a substitute for experiment and observational data, where it is not available. Data-driven discovery via machine learning, deeplearning: a substitute for theory, where it is not available.
4. Deductive and plausible reasoning. If A is true then B is true A is true therefore B is true deductive.  If A is true then B is true B is true therefore A becomes more plausible
5. Logical implication and physical causation are NOT the same. 
The premise “if then B” expresses B only as a logical consequence of A; and not necessarily a casual physical consequence, which could be effective only later.  The rain at 10 am is not the physical cause of the clouds at 9:45 am. Nevertheless, the proper logical connection is not in the uncertain casual direction 
6. George Boole
7. AB the combination of the two example: setting here and breathing (conjunction)
8. AB is logical product and logical sum or disjunction is A+B at least one statement is true A,B
9. In Boolean algebra the equal sign is used to denote equal truth value.

18. The exams are fair and your teaching is great.  My grades at the moment do not reflect that because DATA Science is all new to me but you are doing a great job!
