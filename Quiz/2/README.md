18.  they must contain a main procedure that determines the control flow for the program, and,
they must contain a set of functions that are called to perform certain tasks during program execution, and,
the main and sub-main procedures have a hierarchical structure, and,
the source code for each procedure is compiled, and,
all compiled procedures and the main procedure are linked together with other source codes to produce a complete executable program.
