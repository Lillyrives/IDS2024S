1. Experiment / Observations, Theory / Physical models and Computational / Data-driven models   
2. Predictive xomputing: a workflow bridgin data, hypthesis/theory, and prediction. numerical simulation: a substitute for experiment and observational data, where it is not available. Data-driven discovery via machine learning, deeplearning: a substitute for theory, where it is not available.   
3. Inductive and plausible reasoning
4. "If its raining, then the streets are wet" if its rainy logically the streets are going to be wet but wet streets are not caused directly by the rain in a physical sense.  The wetness of the streets is a consequence of the rain.     
5. A The hears a burglar alarm B Gentleman wearing a mask C This gentleman is dishonest. If A and B then C.

12. a. a bit b. because bit forms the foundation which all other information is built. One bit has two possibilities, and with two, it doubles in possibilities. Each time one is added, the more bits we have, allowing for the encoding of complex data structures and information. Determining coordinates, motion, or speed is only possible with reference points or objects. Additional information such as measurements is needed to provide context and meaningfully interpret position and motion in the universe. c. ![IMG_2143](https://github.com/Lillyrives/IDS2024S/assets/157654675/54434d37-bf90-4040-ba74-ddf849b611e9)
