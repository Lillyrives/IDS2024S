sh (Bourne Shell): 1970s  
2. Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer it was one of many early electronic computers completed in 1945  
3. Integers are important because they can present whole numbers without fractional or decimal parts.  
4. The CPU cache  
5. (HDD) Hard Disk Drive use spinning magnetic disks and mechanical read/write heads to store and retrieve  
6.  Is a bit (Binary Digit)  
7. A. Assembly language
B. It does not require interpretation unlike the high-level languages  
8. A. Fortran (Formula Translation)  
B.  the decade it was created is also an acceptable answer)  it is seven decades old.  First developed in the 1950’s and release was in 1957  
9. A.  Assembly language 
B. Fortran, C and C++ are third generation languages.  MATLAB, Python and R are fourth generation languages  
10.  C programming language and MATLAB were created in the 1970s.  C++ programming language and Python were created in the 1980s    
11.  B developed by Ken Thompson  
12. C is the primary ancestor  
13. MATLAB (Fortran) Python (ABC)  
14. Syntax errors: program that violates the standard of the programming language like missing colon at the end of the if statement.  Runtime errors: it occurs when program is running and results from unexpected conditions or incorrect input data like trying to divide by zero.  Semantic errors: an error that makes the program do something other than what was intended like Incorrect variable usage  
15. Runtime error 
16. We need 18, 446, 744, 073, 709, 551, 615 grains of rice for the last square.  
17. We need approximately 2, 635, 249, 153, 387, 079 pounds of rice to fill all squares  
18. 2080 grains   
19. 66592 grains to fill all the squares  
20. Approximately 9.51314 pounds of rice to fill all squares.  
21. We would need to put 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 grains  
22. We need 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains  
23. Need 2,635,249,153,387,079 pounds  
24. 407,884 years to produce enough rice grains to place on a chessboard in the manner described  
25. Variable and Data Storage, Conditional Branching and Iteration or Looping  
26. Extra credit: Visual Inspection, looking for bends in the curve for exponential behavior and straight-line behavior on a log-log plot for power-law behavior.  Fit to a Model, with regression analysis to fit the data to potential models
