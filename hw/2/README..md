1. Sort the above languages chronologically and write them here.  
Write down the decade during which these languages were developed.  
Lisp: 1950s  
BASIC: 1960s  
Algol 58: Late 1950s  
C: 1970s  
FORTRAN: 1950s  
Fortran 90: 1990s  
Python: 1980s  
C++: 1980s  
C#: 2000s  
Java: 1990s  
JavaScript: 1990s  
sh (Bourne Shell): 1970s  
2. Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer it was one of many early electronic computers completed in 1945  
3. Integers are important because they can present whole numbers without fractional or decimal parts.  
4. The CPU cache  
5. (HDD) Hard Disk Drive use spinning magnetic disks and mechanical read/write heads to store and retrieve  
6.  Is a bit (Binary Digit)  
7. A. Assembly language
B. It does not require interpretation unlike the high-level languages  
8. A. Fortran (Formula Translation)  
B.  the decade it was created is also an acceptable answer)  it is seven decades old.  First developed in the 1950’s and release was in 1957  
9. A.  Assembly language 
B. Fortran, C and C++ are third generation languages.  MATLAB, Python and R are fourth generation languages  
10.  C programming language and MATLAB were created in the 1970s.  C++ programming language and Python were created in the 1980s    
11.  B developed by Ken Thompson  
12. C is the primary ancestor  
13. MATLAB (Fortran) Python (ABC)  
14. Syntax errors: program that violates the standard of the programming language like missing colon at the end of the if statement.  Runtime errors: it occurs when program is running and results from unexpected conditions or incorrect input data like trying to divide by zero.  Semantic errors: an error that makes the program do something other than what was intended like Incorrect variable usage  
15. Runtime error 
16. We need 18, 446, 744, 073, 709, 551, 615 grains of rice for the last square.  
17. We need approximately 2, 635, 249, 153, 387, 079 pounds of rice to fill all squares  
18. 2080 grains
20. 66592 grains to fill all the squares  
21. Approximately 9.51314 pounds of rice to fill all squares.  
22. We would need to put 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 grains  
23. We need 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains  
24. Need 2,635,249,153,387,079 pounds  
25. 407,884 years to produce enough rice grains to place on a chessboard in the manner described
26. Variable and Data Storage, Conditional Branching and Iteration or Looping  
27. Extra credit: Visual Inspection, looking for bends in the curve for exponential behavior and straight-line behavior on a log-log plot for power-law behavior.  Fit to a Model, with regression analysis to fit the data to potential models
28. What is the fastest part of memory in the memory hierarchy of a modern computer? Is the CPU cache.  
29. What are the primary roles of transactions in computers? Atomicity, Consistency,
Isolation and Durability.  
30. We know that more transactions mean faster computers.  Then, why cannot we add more transactions to computers to make them faster? Simply increasing the number of transactions wouldn’t lead to faster computer performance.  
31. What are the three tasks accomplished within a CPU cycle? Fetch, Decode and Execute  
32. Can a powerful computer with more CPU cycles be slower than a computer with less CPU cycles? Why or how? Yes, a computer with more CPU can be slower than a computer with fewer CPU it can be a result of inefficient code, software dependencies, heat and power constraints, resources contention and parallelism and concurrency.  
33.  What is the bottleneck of speed in modern computers? CPU clocks or memory access? Why? The bottleneck lies in memory access rather than CPU clocks so it will spend more time waiting for data from memory and that can limits the overall performance.  
34.  What is the difference between the Dennard Scaling, MOSFET scaling, and Moore’s law? Dennard Scaling keeps transistor performance with size reduction.  MOSFET Scaling shrinks transistors dimensions for performance.   Moore’s Law it doubles transistor count every two years for computing advancement.
