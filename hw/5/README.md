All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic referred to as aesthetics. Size, Shape, Color, Position, Texture, Labeling and Line Style  
Qualitative and Quantitative  
Qualitative Data: also known as categorical data consists of non numeric values that represent categories like dog and cat, Apples, Bananas. Quantitative Data: consists of numeric values that represent quantities and measurements like temperature and height  
Categorical Variables that represent categories or groups and can take on values that belong to a finite set of distinct categories  
Ordered Data: is where there is a clear sequence or ranking among the values like Time and Rating Scales. Unordered Data: refers to data where there is no inherent sequence or ranking among the values like categorical variables (apple, banana) and nominal scales (female, male)  
Quantitative/Qualitative? Month, location and Station Id are qualitative and Day, Temperature are quantitative. Numerical/Categorical? Day, temperature are numerical and month, location, station id are categorical. Continuous/Discrete? Temperature, month and day are continuous and station ID location are discrete.  Order/Unordered? Month, day, temperature are ordered and location, station id are unordered. 
Time, Scale, Spatial and Measurement Axes   
When comparing the height distribution of students in a classroom across different age groups.  With height on the y-axis and individual students on the x-axis the data might show a wide range of heights with a peak around the average height but it can vary when we have different age groups due to growth patterns associated with different stages of development.  Transforming it by calculating the average height for each age group and plotting these averages against the corresponding age groups on the x-axis can create a transformed plot that provides a clearer visualization of the overall trend in height distribution across different age groups  
All of them if you have the set like this no matter how its shape  
Visualizing data that has a directional or cyclical nature like periodic phenomena or circular relationships  
Heat: Best for representing variations in intensity like temperature. ColorBrewer Blues: Best for data where a gradual progression is depicted like ordered data or quantitative data. ColorBrewer PiYG: Best for diverging data with a clear central reference point like positive and negative values around a midpoint. Blue-Red: best for representing data with distinct positive and negative values with contrasting colors for each end of the spectrum 
Inconsistent Scaling, the range of values of the density is significantly smaller than the range for age, this inconsistency can lead to distortion in the visualization making it challenging to compare the relationships between density and age. Potential misleading interpretations. Limited visibility of density variation, the narrow range of values may not adequately capture the variation in density within the dataset  
The first one is because red is a warm and bright color and is more visible  
 Honolulu, HI is hotter. Honolulu has more fluctuation in temperature. y=0.1113x + 72.881 R^2 = 0.491 6. positive correlation

Classical Probability: is based on a simple model of equally likely outcomes Frequent Probability: is based on the frequency of occurrences of an event observed over a large number of experiments. Subjective probability: is based on an individualâ€™s personal judgement or belief about the likelihood of an event occurring. Bayesian probability: which updates prior beliefs or probabilities in light of new evidence or data
