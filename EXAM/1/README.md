1. model validation assesses the overall performance of a predictive model on unseen data and model calibration focuses specifically on ensuring that the predicted probabilities generated by the model are accurate and reliable representations of the true probabilities or outcomes observed in the data. Both validation and calibration are crucial steps in the development and evaluation of predictive models, helping to ensure their accuracy, reliability, and generalizability.
2. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic its referred to as aesthetics 
Size, Shape, Color, Position, Texture, Labeling and Line Style
3. First one because red is a warm and bright color and more visible
4. a. qualitative color scale b. color to represent data values c. divergining color d. color as tool to highlight
5. Experiment / Observations, Theory / Physical models and Computational / Data-driven models
6. does not necessarily imply physical causation "If its raining, then the streets are wet" if its rainy logically the streets are going to be wet but wet streets are not caused directly by the rain in a physical sense. The wetness of the streets is a consequence of the rain.
7. a. no, because the data is getting off the red line b. its not consistant c. positive d. yes because its showing how the tempurature its changing throughout the year e. 188002
8.  classical probability
9.  Classical probability
10. Frequentist probability/propensity 
11. Inconsistent Scaling, the range of values of the density is significantly smaller than the range for age, this inconsistency can lead to distortion in the visualization making it challenging to compare the relationships between density and age 
Potential misleading interpretations. limited visibility of density variation, the narrow range of values may not adequately capture the variation in density within the dataset
12. Integers are important because they can present whole numbers without fractional or decimal parts.
13.  B developed by Ken Thompson
14.  Fortran (formula translate) invented 1954

17.  deductive reasoning if its raining then its cloudy. Plausible reasoning the sky will be cloudy soon 
18.  means its true
19.  cancel
20.  yes
21.  33x34/2 = 560
