1. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic its referred to as aesthetics 
Size, Shape, Color, Position, Texture, Labeling and Line Style.
2. Qualitative, Quantitative
3. Levels of a factor are common without order (cat, fish)
4. Qualitative Data: also known as categorical data consists of non numeric values that represent categories like dog and cat, Apples, Bananas.  Quantitative Data: consists of numeric values that represent quantities and measurements like temperature and height
5. Categorical Variables that represent categories or groups and can take on values that belong to a finite set of distinct categories.
6. Ordered Data: is where there is a clear sequence or ranking among the values like Time and Rating Scales
Unordered Data: refers to data where there is no inherent sequence or ranking among the values like categorical variables (apple, banana) and nominal scales (female, male)
7. Visualizing data that has a directional or cyclical nature like periodic phenomena or circular relationships
8. Heat: Best for representing variations in intensity like temperature
ColorBrewer Blues: Best for data where a gradual progression is depicted like ordered data or quantitative data 
ColorBrewer PiYG: Best for diverging data with a clear central reference point like positive and negative values around a midpoint 
Blue-Red: best for representing data with distinct positive and negative values with contrasting colors for each end of the spectrum
9. Because its overwhelming and hard to read
10. Grades they can be presented as A,B,C,D or 100, 90, 70, 60
11. Categorical/unordered
12. All of them if you have the set like this no matter how its shape  
13. First one because red is a warm and bright color and more visible
14. 1. San Diego 2. Chicago 3 and 4 San Diego
15. a. qualtative color scale b. color to represent data values c. divergining color d. color as a tool to highlight  
16. Color as a tool to highlight accent color scale
17. the different between the dataset is big and it looks messy
18. its going be hotter it looks like maybe from 0 - 2
